what is it?
===========

Ida is a small and fast image viewer, motif-based.  For people who
don't want the KDE/GNOME overhead.  Some basic editing functions are
available too.

added by srmrfm:
(

fbi (FBI? Fbi? idk) is an image viewer for framebuffer consoles.
It lacks most of Ida's editing features and has no file browser,
but is just as capable an image viewer.

Both are capable of fetching images, or even sets of images, for
themselves (removed in later versions, hence the fork) and my fork
adds https capability (ok, I just made it recognise https:// URLs, curl
does all the work).

fbpdf is a framebuffer pdf viewer, but Gerd Hoffman didn't describe it
(or fbi) here and tbh i've never used it.

fbgs is fbpdf's predecessor. Gerd doesn't recommend using it and iirc it's just a script.

build
=====

Check the INSTALL file for detailed build instructions.

ida uses Motif 2.x features (utm, render tables).  This means you need
openmotif, lesstif does *not* cut it.

It also uses the usual graphics libraries (libtiff, libpng, libjpeg,
...), you should have them installed to get support for these image
formats.


usage
=====

There is a manual page, check it out.


what "ida" stands for?
======================

It is just a name.  The utility used to be named "iv" for "Image
Viewer", but that gave lots of name clashes.  Its very likely that
people name such a tool "iv", it is also used as shortcut for
InterViews (remember Sun's Open Windows?).  So i decided to rename it.

I looked for a short name starting with 'i' in a list for children
first names.  I like "ida", so I picked this one.  It is a old, german
name.


Have fun,

  Gerd
